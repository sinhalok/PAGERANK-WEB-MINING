# PAGERANK-WEB-MINING

Write a program to display the page rank of the given directed graph representing
web of six pages and damping factor is 0.9. Input to the program must be adjacency
matrix or adjacency list of the given web graph along with damping factor and
threshold value (stopping criteria:- Îµ = 0.05). The program must print the result after
each of the following scenario:
a. Handling the nodes with no outgoing links
b. Stochastic matrix formation
c. Page rank of all the six nodes after each iteration
d. Total number iteration count until stopping criteria.
